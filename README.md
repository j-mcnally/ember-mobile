Ember Mobile
============

This is just a sample project that I am using to build out the basic stuff eventually everything will be abstracted into a gem.

To get it running checkout the project.

run `bundle install`

run `middleman build`

run `middleman`

connect to `localhost:4567`


Uses Adam Whitcrofts' awsome, Batch Icon Webfont for Glyphs/Icons.
